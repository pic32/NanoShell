This is a platform independent shell for use with any system.
The Generic Buffers and Linked List libraries are just for support.

Main inspiration for this project came from the microshell (https://github.com/marcinbor85/microshell).
I just wanted to learn more about shell interfaces and have a simple working one.

The next project will be called the NexShell which will use the FatFs and the NexOS.
This will have much more support for a Unix type shell interface.
