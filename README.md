This is a platform independent shell for use with any system.
The Generic Buffers and Linked List libraries are just for support.

Main inspiration for this project came from the microshell (https://github.com/marcinbor85/microshell).
I just wanted to learn more about shell interfaces and have a simple working one.

The next project will be called the NexShell which will use the FatFs and the NexOS.
This will have much more support for a Unix type shell interface.

This shell has support for the following:
 - Color coded prompt and text
 - Built in commands
   *  cat       (extended support available)
   *  cd        (extended support available)
   *  clear
   *  echo      (extended support available)
   *  help      (extended support available)
   *  ls        (extended support available)
   *  pwd
   *  shutdown  (extended support available)
 - Command history (optional)
 - Home directory with ~ character (optional)
 - Extended command functionality (optional)
 - Configurable character echo support (optional)
 - File descriptions and help section (optional)
 - Directory descriptions (optional)
